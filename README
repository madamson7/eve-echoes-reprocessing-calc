Welcome!

I created this calculator so I could attempt to tackle the vast economics in Eve Echoes and hopefully come out on top making some Isk along the way as an Industrialist / Reprocessor.
I've seen other similar calculators and YouTube videos showcasing this method but some authors decided not to share their knowledge with the community; I disagreed and thought "I can do this myself".

So here it is. Please make a copy of the sheet for your own use.

If you find any issues please let me know. I've done some testing while making each part but now I feel it is ready for wider use.

I plan on making a YouTube video guide on how to use the Calculator and will include a link to it when it is available.
